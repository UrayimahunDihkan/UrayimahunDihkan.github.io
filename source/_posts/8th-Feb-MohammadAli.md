I'm happy because I'm fulfilling my purpose of life. See , everything was created for purpose , the moon has a purpose , rats have a purpose , insects ... , everything god created has a purpose. The wise man and he who knows his life purpose , see 10 men with the knowledge of their purpose , or more powerful than 1000 men working from morning until evening and who don't know their purpose.     -- MohammadAli
