From the time I began to work after graduation, there was an issue born and have been becoming bigger, yet I never faced and answered this properly.

The issue is, once I began to earn money by working every day, I became anxious for future,  what should I do one day if got released or there is a lay off, how to get rid off this before the day come. I think this issue someshow confuses every individual man.

Seemingly, I am doing so hard to save that much money that enough to afford my old years ...

Ok then,  another issue comes, what's meaning of life. We are all born by Adam and Eva, we are not machine parts.
